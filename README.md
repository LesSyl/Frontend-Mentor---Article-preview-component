- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Grid
- JS

### What I learned
It's a project I've had a lot of fun with, but I've also learnt a lot. First and foremost, I learned how to combine html, CSS and JS. Thanks to this solution, I know how the code should be created in html and how to oscillate it in order to easily enrich it in JS.
